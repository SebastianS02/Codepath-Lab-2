# Codepath-Lab-2

To run this project, first clone the repo into VScode. Once that is done, run the following commands in your terminal:
1: cd Samosa-Selector
2: npm i
3: npm run dev

The purpose of this project is to learn more about useState and buttons in React. When you run the website, you can click on the Samosa image to increase your Samosa counter. Once you have enough, you can buy a counter multiplier to increase the amount your samosa counter increases when clicking the image. When you click on the button however, the appropriate amount of samosas is deducted from your counter.
